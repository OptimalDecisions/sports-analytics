## Statistics

### Basics of Stats

[Exploratory Data Analysis - NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm) Very good intro to several concepts.
[Probability Distributions - NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda36.htm) - Comprehensive, with good explanations
[Classical Statistical Methos - NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35.htm) There are tons of tests to be used in different circumstances. These are very good as reference. (No need to memorize, but good to be aware that these exist.)
### Stats related Colab Notebooks


- [Practice Basic Stats in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gmention-at-cea/sos2021/blob/main/SOS2021_practice_Basic_statistics.ipynb) Several good explanations, esp the illustrations

- [Correlation - Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/blob/master/examples/correlation.ipynb)

- [Elements of Data Science](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience) - Allen Downey's entire Book is excellent
