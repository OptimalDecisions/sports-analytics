### Update #3 Contents
- Main Contest update
- India mini-contest 1 update
- New Mini-contest 2 - India vs NZ

### Main Contest
Still not able to show anything significant in the Leaderboard. Only 1/3 of the Group stage games are over, so any of the top 6 teams could qualify.
Speculation: It does seem like India and NZ will coast into the next stage. It is going to be a dogfight to the finish between ENG, AUS, PAK, and SA for the other two spots.

### Mini-Contest #1 Update - India vs all Opponents

To my surprise, 42 people participated in this mini-contest.
10 of the 42 participants are predicting that India will win ALL of its Group Stage games -- Call them patriots, knowledgeable, or optimists. These 10 are Goutham Ekollu, #ash, Arvind Narayanan, Krishnaveni K, Aditya Madhavan, Kunal Soni, Kshitij, Keshav Venkatesh, Rupal, and Pushpa Parthasarathy.
The rest of us are predicting that India will lose 1 or 2 matches. No one felt that India would lose more than 3 matches.

Even though predicting that a game would have "No result" was an option, only one person took the bait. Shriya Sateesh is predicting no results for the England game.

The leaderboard for this mini-contest has been scored until the IND-BAN game. It can be found here: [https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/icc2023/mini1](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/icc2023/mini1)

## New Mini-contest #2 - India vs NZ on Oct 22

Our next mini-contest is now open. It is a "match line" contest -- meaning all the predictions are around one single match. So we will know the winners right after the match ends.
There is a very important (for prestige) game coming up this Sunday, Oct 22. Both India and NZ are unbeaten, and this game will force the issue of who's top dog. Already, some are saying that this could be a preview of the Finals.
The IND-vs-NZ mini-contest has only 3 questions. But it is a bit tricky. You will have to choose from many good choices. Plus, you are "wagering" points -- you will get negative points if your prediction is wrong! So pick carefully. Remember, you can only select one choice for each question.

(Please submit your entry before the first ball gets bowled. Saturday night in North America/Europe, Sunday morning in India/Australia.) This contest entry form should only take a minute to fill.
