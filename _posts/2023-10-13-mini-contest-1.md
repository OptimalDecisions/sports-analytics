This second update comes sooner than I'd have liked to send it out. Reason: The India-Pak game starts in a little over 24 hours. And this mini-contest entry has to close before the first ball gets bowled.

## South Africa in, Australia Out?
The Aussies have lost both their first 2 matches. And SA has won both and convincingly. There's still a long way to go, but it's always fun to speculate.

Pretty much everyone has picked AUS somewhere in the top 4 at the end of the Pool stage. And only **10** people thought SA had a chance. 9 of those 10 picked them to finish 4th. And **nine** have picked Australia to win it all. So if Australia gets eliminated, it is going to shake things up.

Again, it is probably too early for this line of thinking.

## Mini-Contest #1 - India's performance in the remaining 7 matches

This will take less than 1 minute. Really. Plus, I can publish a leaderboard after each one of India's matches. (One small caveat: If a match gets tied/drawn/rained out, then you won't get a point if you picked a winner.) 1 point for each correct prediction. Max possible score: 7 points.
