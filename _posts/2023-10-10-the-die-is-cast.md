# The Predictions

All:

For this ICC WC Prediction contest, we have 66 entries, from 4 continents -- North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Thank you all for playing along.

### So what are people predicting?

You can find the complete list of individual [predictions here.](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/icc2023/predictions)

The contest participants are overwhelmingly predicting that India will win this year.
Are people projecting their wishful thinking, or do they truly believe this? This question is unanswerably confounding since all the participants are of Indian descent, and India is also ranked #1 in ODI's in 2023.

Australia and England are the other two countries picked as likely winners by around 8-9 contestants each.

### Long shots
NZ, PAK, BAN, and NED have also been picked once each as possible winners. If any of these 4 countries win, the person who chose them will almost surely be the outright winners, because there are a lot of points at stake for picking the overall Winner correctly. No one has picked AFG, SL, or SA to win the World Cup.

### Two Automated Entries
In addition to the 66 human entries, I have created 2 "automated" entries. One is simply picking based on the ODI Rankings just before the World Cup started. In many ways, this is the "safest bet" one could make. The second one is the **Wisdom of the Crowd** entry. To create that entry, I selected the country that the majority of us picked for each slot (Q1, Q2, etc.) The idea for that entry is to represent the so-called "wisdom of the crowd," which is our collective belief. Let's see how these automated entries fare compared to our individual predictions.

### Mini Contests
Several of you have written to me about other ways to make the contest more interesting! One big flaw in the current format is that we have to wait until November for the Leaderboard to show anything meaningful. I really like the idea of holding "mini-contests." I will create one or two soon and send those out.

I plan to send out an update or a mini-contest once every few days, just to keep the interest level up. You can always find the latest leaderboard at: [https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests)

Stay tuned,
