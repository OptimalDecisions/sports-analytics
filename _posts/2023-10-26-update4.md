## Update #4 Contents
- Main Contest Leaderboard update
- India Contest Leaderboard update
- India vs NZ  Mini-contest #2 - Results & Winners

### Main Contest
25 of the 45 group-stage games are done. All the teams have played 5 games each, with 4 more matches to go for each team. The 4 Semifinalists are more or less decided. There might be some last-minute jockeying for position.

And at long last, the leaderboard is no longer random. I've assigned all of us a provisional score and used that to sort the leaderboard. Only one person, Sackett from the SF Bay Area, has predicted all 4 teams (IND, SA, NZ, AUS) in that correct order. But the final rankings could change, of course.

### Mini #1 Update
India has been dominant thus far, winning all 5 of it matches. So kudos to all of you who were bullish enough to pick India in all the matches. Your picks are looking good at the moment. India still has 4 more matches -- against ENG, SA, SL and NED.

### Mini #2 - India v NZ
38 people participated in the predicting the Ind-v-NZ game. Luck was (by design) a huge factor in this mini-contest. Everything could have gone differently. The first team (NZ) scored 273, 2 short of 275. Kohli scored 96 and thus no Indian hit a century. When chasing, India lost 6 wickets, not 7. Thanks to negative points (esp in riskier picks) the leaderboard would have looked very different had even one of these changed. The old sports betting lesson holds here: If you are going to pick long odds, be prepared to lose a lot of money.

We have 4 winners: **Rahul Santhanam, Tees, Gokul, and Krishnaveni Kumbaji**. Congrats on winning **mini#2!**
