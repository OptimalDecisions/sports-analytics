## Main Contest Update
The Prediction Scores have been updated after the group stage. 
I've added one new column, called Theoretical Max, which is the theoretical maximum number of points you can hope to get if all the results go your way. Sackett, for one example, could win 32 points more and score a mighty impressive 46/48 points.

# ICC2023 Semifinals Prediction Contest
The new prediction contest for both the semi matches incorporates several suggestions that I received. The points favor those who guess the winning teams correctly. And you have to get a couple of other predictions right to win. There are no negative points. Note that two of the questions are based on both matches (4 innings).

Next update - On Nov 15, after the India-NZ match.

Good luck!
