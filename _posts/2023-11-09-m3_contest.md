Congratulations to **Goutham Ekollu, #ash, Aditya, Arvind, Goutham, Keshav V., Krishnaveni, Kshitij, Kunal, Pushpa and Rupal**. Well done!

### Mini-contest #3 -- India vs SA Winners
This past Sunday, India faced South Africa in Kolkata's Eden Gardens and won extremely convincingly. This mini-contest had negative scoring, which made prediction even more difficult. Congrats to Mukund Narasimhan and Sreenivas Gollapudi, for getting all 3 right and for wagering enough to pip ahead. Bharath, Keshav N, Santhanam, and Goutham also got all the predictions right. Congratulations!

### The Semifinals Predictions Contest -- Opens on Sunday
Our next mini-contest is a double-header, featuring both the semifinal games in one single contest. There will be no negative points, but you will have to predict the outcomes of both matches to win. Two exciting days of cricket coming up next week.
