### Update #5 Contents
- Main Contest Leaderboard updated
- India v All (mini#1) Contest Leaderboard update
- India vs SA - Launch mini-contest #3 (deadline Saturday night)


### Main Contest Leaderboard (updated after the India-SL game)

With 33 of the 45 group-stage matches done, the teams that will qualify are becoming clearer. India sits at the top of the table, dominant. With just 12 matches to go, there are still a lot of what-ifs to be pondered. SA could dethrone India for the number 1 spot if they win on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Pakistan (or Afghanistan) are hoping to squeeze in, but that will mean they have to edge out NZ, which won't be easy.
Based on the current standings (IND > SA > AUS > NZ), I've assigned all of us a provisional score and used that to sort the leaderboard. Sackett from the SF Bay Area is the sole leader, but 4 others are just 2 points behind him.

### Mini #1 update
India has been dominant thus far, winning all 7 of its matches. So kudos to all of you who were bullish enough to pick India in all the matches. Your picks are looking good at the moment. India still has 2 more matches -- against SA and NED.

### TableTopper Mini-contest #3 -- Now Open
On Sunday, there's a key game coming up this Sunday. India will face South Africa in Kolkata's Eden Gardens. Your task is simple: Make 3 predictions -- about the 1st innings score, high-scorers, and the winners. High points if you choose to make a riskier prediction, but you lose more if you are wrong!
