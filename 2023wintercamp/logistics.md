Start: 15 December 2023

1. You will be using your own laptops for analyzing.
1. In this camp, there are no tests, no exams, no preparations needed. No competitions. We all have different goals when it comes to learning.
2. We will be using Colab, which runs on the Cloud
3. We will need to find and download data relating to your sport of choice
3. When possible, we will stay away from Sports Betting. However, sometimes the data is useful, as are some insights in those blogs/analyses.
3. Think of this camp as a opportunity to "tinker" with some data, stats and plots relating to any sport you happen to love.
4. Optionally, there is a capstone project. 
   This will be a small analytics project that we will select together and you will work on. The participants will write a small proposal, and once agreed upon, they will work on the project.
5. The goal is to "showcase" the capstone project. That can be from your GitHub account, a website or by writing a "white paper." 
6. If a participant attends the interactive sessions, and complete a capstone sport data analysis project, they will be given a Certificate saying that they have completed the "Basics of Sports Analytics" course.
