Start: 15 December 2023

End: 30 Jan 2024

1. You will be using your own laptops for analyzing.
2. We will be using Colab, which runs on the Cloud
3. We will need to find and download data relating to your sport of choice
4. Optionally, there is a capstone project. 
   This will be a small analytics project that we will select together and you will work on. The participants will write a small proposal, and once agreed upon, they will work on the project.
5. The goal is to "showcase" this project. That can be in your GitHub account, a website or by writing a "white paper." 
6. If a participant attends the interactive sessions, and complete a capstone sport data analysis project, they will be given a Certificate saying that they have completed the "Basics of Sports Analytics" course.
