Please note that this schedule is subject to change, depending on Holiday travel.
Some (but not all) sessions will be recorded.

**The Sports Analytics camp runs from Dec 15, 2023 to Jan 31, 2024**

### Interactive Sessions 
**(Zoom, 3 x 1 hour each per week) **

The goal is to have 2-3 Zoom sessions (of 1 hour duration each)

The interactive sessions will be one of three tracks, each week:
1. **Sports Track** (Questions, Obtaining data, metrics, win probability)
2. **Tech Track** (Coding/Python/Setup/Data)
3. **Math and Stat Track** (Descriptive, bi-variate, Correlations, Predictive analysis)
    - We need to understand a little bit of theory to be able to carry out our own analysis. We will be looking at examples to understand the underlying mathematical and statistical ideas.
