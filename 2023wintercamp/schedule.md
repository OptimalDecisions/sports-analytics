**The Sports Analytics camp runs from Dec 15, 2023 to Jan 31, 2024**

### Interactive Sessions 

**(Zoom, 3 x 1 hour each per week)**

The goal is to have 2-3 Zoom sessions each week (~ of 1 hour duration )

The interactive sessions will be one of three tracks, each week:
1. **Sports Track** (Questions, Obtaining data, metrics, win probability)

    -   We will cover a range of topics related to sports data analysis, techniques to ask good and quantifiable questions, ways to obtain data, thought experiements relating to sports, games, wins, players and venues.

2. **Tech Track** (Coding/Python/Setup/Data)

    - The tech tracks covers the tools we all use (Colab/Jupyter/GitHub/HTML/XPath) and the programming cocepts underlying data analysis and algorithms. 

3. **Math and Stat Track** (Descriptive, bi-variate, Correlations, Predictive analysis)
    - We need to understand a little bit of theory to be able to carry out our own analysis. We will be looking at examples to understand the underlying mathematical and statistical ideas.
